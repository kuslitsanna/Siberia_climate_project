# Siberia_climate_project

-   **Problem:** The effects of global climate change have been particularly severe in the Siberia region of North Asia. Frequent and intense heat waves in recent years are resulting in the rapid melting of permafrost, causing significant transformations in the region's landscape. The warming climate is creating shifts in precipitation patterns, affecting water resources and impacting ecosystems and human activities. As the release of greenhouse gases from thawing permafrost contributes to further climate change, these changes have important global implications.

-   **Objective:** This project used historical daily weather-station observations from the Global Historical Climatology Network - Daily (GHCN-Daily) dataset hosted in [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/gcp/global-historical-daily-weather-data-now-available-in-bigquery) to analyse and visualise trends in the data, and forecast potential future climatic changes in the Siberia region.

-   **Method:**

The analysis looked at 4 core elements in the GHCN dataset:

|      |                                         |
|------|-----------------------------------------|
| TMAX | maximum daily temperature in degrees C  |
| TMIN | minimum daily temperature in degrees C  |
| PRCP | daily precipitation in millimetres      |
| SNWD | daily snow depth in millimetres         |

Examined period: 1983-01-01 to 2023-07-01
